Items are stored in Assets/Resources/Items folder. You can add new items here by right click Inventory->item. All items will be loaded at start.
Craft schemas are stored in Assets/Resources/Schemas. You also can add new schemas by right click Inventory->Schema. All schemas are loaded at start.
You can check my scripts in Assets/Scripts folder :)
